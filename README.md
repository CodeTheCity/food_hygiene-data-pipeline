# food_hygiene-data-pipeline


Food hygiene is a very important aspect in modern sociatal interation 
This project came about due to a personal experience faced by me and some my univesity collegues during our time in the masters.
We all belive that usability and easy of consumption of UK food hygiene data is critical to for the well being of citizens like you of me.

As a first step during CTC29 we created an automated data pipeline that ingested the food hygiene data from England and Scotland to a Tableau frontend. 
The code and resultant test data are haosted here.
