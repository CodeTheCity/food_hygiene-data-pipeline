# food_hygiene-data-pipeline

Food hygiene is a very important aspect of modern society's interaction 
This project came about due to a personal experience I and some of my university colleagues faced during our time in the master's programme.
We all believe that the usability and ease of consumption of UK food hygiene data are critical to the well-being of citizens like you and me.

As a first step during CTC29, we created an automated data pipeline that ingested the food hygiene data from the UK to a Tableau front. 
The code and dashboard are hosted here.
